# Drill_project
HTML &amp; CSS Drill final project

Except fot the the images file, both the css files (animations_1.css) and (shared_1.css) were hand coded.
I went through them two times each to debug after their creation. I also hand coded the 'index.html' page.

The index.html page took about 4 rounds of debugging before I got the website to load like the comparision.
Got a good deal of time writing out code, which helped getting familiar with Visual Studio IDE. Plus getting me better used to reading code.

This has been a great experience overall and I learned I still have a lot to learn. I left a few comments behind in all the files 
explaining about certain bugs I discovered in my code along the way. It's very easy to cause by forgetting something, and it's 
usually caught if you at least go over your code line by line when it's complete.
